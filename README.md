## Overview

This is a sample Rails project that gets Facebook authentication (with popups!) working with Devise.

## Usage

Clone & run. Feel free to update the User schema and model to fit your needs. I highly recommend that you update the access token every time you get it, since it expires in 2 hours without the offline access scope.

## TODO

- tests
- better handling of authentication failures
